# Documentation System

This directory contains the Docz-based documentation system -- generated documentation for the MDS.

- `./src`: Custom Gatsby theme used by Docz build.
- `./content`: Generic MDS documentation not associated with specific components or packages.
- `./design`: Assets (images, etc.) referenced in `MDX` files that are part of the generated documentation.
- `./helpers`: Common components used in `MDX` files solely to generate documentation
